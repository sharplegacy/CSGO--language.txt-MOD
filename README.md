# CSGO--language.txt-MOD
renamed Ranks &amp; Descriptions!

#How to install:
1. Choose which version you want, then copy csgo_legacymod.txt
2. Paste the file inside this folder: 
Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource <--
3. Add "-language legacymod" in launch options without quotes
4. Restart your game

Not working? Make sure that:
* csgo_bananagaming.txt is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
* Launch options spelled correctly, this is an example how it can look in launch options:
-novid -language bananagaming -tickrate 128 -nojoy
